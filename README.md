# analyticsnake
this library is for doing basic data science and analytics, with functions like finding standard deviation, the slope of a line, or correlation  between 2 data sets with much more to come. I am a beginner programmer so help would be much appreciated, and feel free to contribute any improvements or requests you might have.
